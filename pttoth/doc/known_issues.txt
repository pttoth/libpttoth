in progress:
    - invalid query exceptions don't contain info about the key and value pair
        fix: added _buildErrorStringInvalidValue(int eKey) prototype, need testing

	std_extension
		stringToLower + Upper
			remove unnecessary copy ctor
		SplitString
			fix 'char const *' param to 'const char *'
			check whether it fails if there is no occurence of separator sequence
		trimWhitespaces
			in the if-else code, fix the indentation to a more readable one
		

other:
    - Logger is unfinished
        - no multicore handling
        (win only)
            - missing folder creation
            - missing timestamp creation for log filenames

    - event doesn't handle multiple registrations of the same function
    - event.add() should be named event.addListener()/addCallback()
        same for remove()

    - various camelcase problems

Config:
    - error prints should use "CONFIG: " in front of every message
        maybe even print config file path
        it should use logger::debug as message output
	- outputs wrong error message when trying to write read-only config file
	- need to check other behaviors regarding read / write access to files
