in progress:
    - missing char handling in Config
        fix: added prototype, need testing

    - invalid query exceptions don't contain info about the key and value pair
        fix: added _buildErrorStringInvalidValue(int eKey) prototype

other:
    - Logger is unfinished
        - no multicore handling
        (win only)
            - missing folder creation
            - missing timestamp creation for log filenames

    - event doesn't handle multiple registrations of the same function
    - event.add() should be named event.addListener()/addCallback()
        same for remove()

    - various camelcase problems

Config:
    - error prints should use "CONFIG: " in front of every message
        maybe even print config file path
